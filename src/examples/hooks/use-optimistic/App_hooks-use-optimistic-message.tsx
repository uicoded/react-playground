  âœ… Use the `useOptimistic` hook to manage optimistic UI updates by getting handle of optimistic state and setOptimistic function.

  https://react.dev/reference/react/useOptimistic

  unlike `useTransition()` which can be used to prevent the UI from changing when the component is suspended,
  `useOptimistic()` allows the UI to update with the optimistic state while the real state is being updated
  in the background, giving the appearance of instant updates.

  ðŸ‘‰ Use it for scenarios where you want to give users instant feedback, like submitting a form or toggling a like button before
   confirming with the server that the operation was successful.

  `optimisticValue`: The current value, which may reflect an optimistic update if one is in progress.
  `setOptimisticValue`: A function to set an optimistic value, typically called with an action (e.g., form data)
                        and paired with an async operation. I takes in two parameters. The `currentState` and the `optimisticValue`.

  - Provide the current state and an update function that computes the optimistic state based on an action.
  - When you call `setOptimisticValue`, React immediately updates the UI with the optimistic value.
  - If the async operation (e.g., a server request), React reverts to the original state.
  - Unlike `useTransition`, it doesnâ€™t inherently manage pending statesâ€”you handle the async flow manually or pair it with other hooks.

  See: docs/react-hooks-use-optimistic-fully-typed.md for details
