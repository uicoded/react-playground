/**
 * ðŸ”¥ What Happens Here?s

1. On Initial Page Load:
    - `MyComponent.js` is not downloaded because it is wrapped in `React.lazy()`.
    - The app only loads the main bundle (e.g., App.js).

2. When Button is Clicked (setShow(true)):
    - `MyComponent` enters the React tree for the first time.
    - At this moment, React triggers a network request to fetch `MyComponent.js`.
    - The Suspense fallback (Loading...) is shown until the component loads.

3. On Subsequent Renders:
    - If `show` is toggled off and on again, `MyComponent.js` does not reload because
     it was already loaded into memory.


  âœ… Key Takeaways:

  - Lazy loading delays fetching the component until it's actually needed.
  - The first render triggers the network request, which is why there may be a visible delay.
  - Once loaded, the component stays in memory, so it doesn't need to be reloaded.
