# `useTransition()` vs `useOptimistic()`

## `useTransition`

**Purpose**: `useTransition` is used to mark state updates as **non-urgent transitions**, allowing React to prioritize more critical updates (e.g., user interactions like typing or clicking) to keep the UI responsive. It’s ideal for updates that might be computationally expensive or involve asynchronous operations like data fetching.

**Syntax**:
```javascript
const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();
```

- **`isPending`**: A boolean indicating whether the transition is in progress.
- **`startTransition`**: A function you wrap around state updates to mark them as transitions.

**How It Works**:
- You wrap state updates in `startTransition(() => { ... })` to tell React to treat them as non-urgent.
- React processes these updates in the background, prioritizing urgent updates (e.g., direct user input) first.
- While the transition is pending, `isPending` is `true`, allowing you to show a loading state.
- Often used with `<Suspense>` for data fetching or lazy-loaded components.

**Example**:
```javascript
function App() {
  const [input, setInput] = useState('');
  const [list, setList] = useState([]);
  const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();

  const handleChange = (e) => {
    setInput(e.target.value);
    startTransition(() => {
      const newList = Array(10000).fill(e.target.value).map((val, i) => `${val}-${i}`);
      setList(newList);
    });
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <input type="text" value={input} onChange={handleChange} />
      {isPending ? <p>Loading...</p> : <p>Results: {list.length}</p>}
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Use Case**: Filtering a large list, navigating between views, or fetching data where you want to keep the UI responsive during the update.

## `useOptimistic`

**Purpose**: `useOptimistic` is used to **optimistically update the UI** before an asynchronous operation (like a server request) completes, assuming the operation will succeed. It provides a way to show an immediate, temporary UI update and roll back to the previous state if the operation fails. It’s ideal for scenarios where you want to give users instant feedback, like submitting a form or toggling a like button.

**Syntax**:
```javascript
const [optimisticValue, setOptimisticValue] = useOptimistic(currentValue, updateFunction);
```

- **`optimisticValue`**: The current value, which may reflect an optimistic update if one is in progress.
- **`setOptimisticValue`**: A function to set an optimistic value, typically called with an action (e.g., form data) and paired with an async operation.

**How It Works**:
- You provide the current state and an **update function** that computes the optimistic state based on an action.
- When you call `setOptimisticValue`, React immediately updates the UI with the optimistic value.
- You perform the async operation (e.g., a server request) and, if it fails, React reverts to the original state.
- Unlike `useTransition`, it doesn’t inherently manage pending states—you handle the async flow manually or pair it with other hooks.

**Example**:
```javascript
function App() {
  const [messages, setMessages] = useState([]);
  const [optimisticMessages, setOptimisticMessage] = useOptimistic(
    messages,
    (currentMessages, newMessage) => [...currentMessages, newMessage]
  );

  const submitMessage = async (formData) => {
    const newMessage = { id: Date.now(), text: formData.get('message') };
    // Optimistically update the UI
    setOptimisticMessage(newMessage);
    
    try {
      // Simulate server request
      await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));
      setMessages((prev) => [...prev, newMessage]);
    } catch (error) {
      // If the request fails, React reverts to the original messages
      console.error('Failed to send message');
    }
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <form action={submitMessage}>
        <input type="text" name="message" />
        <button type="submit">Send</button>
      </form>
      <ul>
        {optimisticMessages.map((msg) => (
          <li key={msg.id}>{msg.text}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Use Case**: Optimistically showing a new chat message, toggling a like button, or updating a UI element before confirming with the server.

### Key Differences Between `useTransition` and `useOptimistic`

| Feature/Aspect                | `useTransition`                                                                 | `useOptimistic`                                                                 |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**                   | Marks state updates as non-urgent to keep the UI responsive during heavy tasks. | Updates the UI optimistically before an async operation completes, with rollback on failure. |
| **Syntax**                    | `const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();`                        | `const [optimisticValue, setOptimisticValue] = useOptimistic(state, updateFn);` |
| **Primary Concern**           | Prioritizing urgent vs. non-urgent updates.                                    | Providing instant UI feedback for async operations.                            |
| **Pending State**             | Provides `isPending` to track transition progress.                             | No built-in pending state; you manage async flow manually.                     |
| **UI Feedback**               | Shows loading states during transitions (e.g., with `isPending`).              | Shows optimistic UI immediately, reverting if the operation fails.             |
| **Rollback Mechanism**        | No rollback; transitions complete or interrupt based on React’s scheduling.     | Automatically reverts to the original state if the async operation fails.      |
| **Suspense Integration**      | Often used with `<Suspense>` for data fetching or lazy loading.                | Not directly tied to `<Suspense>`; focused on state updates.                   |
| **Typical Use Cases**         | Filtering large datasets, navigating views, fetching data.                     | Submitting forms, toggling likes, adding comments optimistically.              |
| **Control Over Updates**      | You mark updates as transitions with `startTransition`.                        | You provide an update function to compute the optimistic state.                |
| **Async Handling**            | Can wrap async updates but doesn’t manage the async flow itself.               | Requires you to handle the async operation and update the real state.          |

### When to Use Each

- **Use `useTransition`** when:
  - You have a potentially slow or computationally expensive state update (e.g., filtering a large list or fetching data).
  - You want to keep the UI responsive while the update is processed.
  - You need to show a loading state during the update (using `isPending`).
  - Example: Filtering a product catalog or loading a new page section while allowing the user to keep interacting with the UI.

- **Use `useOptimistic`** when:
  - You want to provide instant feedback for an async operation, assuming it will succeed (e.g., posting a comment).
  - You need to show the updated UI immediately and handle potential failures by reverting the state.
  - You’re dealing with user actions that benefit from optimistic updates, like social media interactions.
  - Example: Showing a new message in a chat app before the server confirms it was saved.

---

### Can They Be Used Together?

Yes, `useTransition` and `useOptimistic` can be complementary in some cases. For example:
- Use `useTransition` to manage a non-urgent state update (e.g., fetching new data after a form submission).
- Use `useOptimistic` to show an immediate, optimistic UI update while the transition is pending.

Here’s an example combining both:

```javascript
function CommentApp() {
  const [comments, setComments] = useState([]);
  const [optimisticComments, setOptimisticComment] = useOptimistic(
    comments,
    (current, newComment) => [...current, newComment]
  );
  const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();

  const submitComment = async (formData) => {
    const newComment = { id: Date.now(), text: formData.get('comment') };
    setOptimisticComment(newComment); // Show optimistic update immediately

    startTransition(() => {
      // Simulate a slow server request
      setTimeout(() => {
        setComments((prev) => [...prev, newComment]);
      }, 2000);
    });
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <form action={submitComment}>
        <input type="text" name="comment" />
        <button type="submit">Add Comment</button>
      </form>
      {isPending && <p>Processing...</p>}
      <ul>
        {optimisticComments.map((comment) => (
          <li key={comment.id}>{comment.text}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this case:
- `useOptimistic` shows the new comment immediately.
- `useTransition` ensures the actual state update (e.g., after a server request) doesn’t block the UI, with `isPending` indicating progress.

---

### Conclusion

- **`useTransition`** is about **prioritizing updates** to keep the UI responsive during non-urgent tasks. It’s great for heavy computations or async data fetching where you want to show a loading state.
- **`useOptimistic`** is about **instant feedback** for async operations, showing an optimistic UI and reverting on failure. It’s ideal for user-driven actions where latency would feel sluggish.
- **Key Difference**: `useTransition` manages the scheduling of updates with a pending state, while `useOptimistic` manages temporary state changes with automatic rollback.

Where responsiveness during slow updates is critical, use `useTransition`. To make async actions feel instantaneous (like in a social app), use `useOptimistic`. In some cases, combining them can create a seamless experience.
