# React lazy vs dynamic import

`React.lazy()` is specifically designed for **code-splitting** and **lazy-loading** React components. However, it only works with **statically defined imports**, meaning the import path must be known at build time.

### ✅ What You *Can* Do with `React.lazy()`
1. **Lazy load a component with a fixed path:**
   ```jsx
   import React, { Suspense } from "react";

   const MyComponent = React.lazy(() => import("./MyComponent"));

   const App = () => (
     <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
       <MyComponent />
     </Suspense>
   );

   export default App;
   ```
   - The component is loaded only when it is first rendered.

2. **Use it with React Router for route-based lazy loading:**
   ```jsx
   import { BrowserRouter as Router, Routes, Route } from "react-router-dom";
   import React, { Suspense } from "react";

   const Home = React.lazy(() => import("./Home"));
   const About = React.lazy(() => import("./About"));

   const App = () => (
     <Router>
       <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
         <Routes>
           <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
           <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
         </Routes>
       </Suspense>
     </Router>
   );

   export default App;
   ```
   - Components are loaded only when their routes are accessed.

3. **Use `React.lazy()` in combination with `ErrorBoundary` to handle loading failures:**
   ```jsx
   const MyComponent = React.lazy(() => import("./MyComponent"));

   const App = () => (
     <ErrorBoundary fallback={<div>Error loading component</div>}>
       <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
         <MyComponent />
       </Suspense>
     </ErrorBoundary>
   );
   ```

### 🔥 When Should You Use `React.lazy()`?
- When you want to **code-split** and **load components on demand**.
- When you are **sure** about the import paths at build time.
- When you are using **React Router** to optimize loading for different pages.


### ❌ What You *Cannot* Do with `React.lazy()`
1. **You can't pass a dynamic import path** because `import()` must be static.
   ```jsx
   const DynamicComponent = React.lazy(() => import(filePath)); ❌ // Won't work
   ```
   - This is because `import()` is **evaluated at build time**, and React needs to know all potential imports.

2. **You can't use it for dynamically changing components based on props.** Instead, you must use a workaround like `useState` + `useEffect`

## Dynamic Import without `React.lazy()`

You cannot directly use `React.lazy` with a dynamic import path because `import()` only works with static strings. However, you can work around this by using a wrapper component that dynamically imports the correct module whenever the path prop changes.

### Solution:
1. Use a state variable to store the dynamically imported component.
2. Use `useEffect` to listen for changes in the file path.
3. Import the component dynamically and update the state.

### Implementation:

```jsx
import React, { Suspense, useState, useEffect } from "react";

const DynamicComponent = ({ filePath }) => {
  const [Component, setComponent] = useState(null);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
  const [error, setError] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (!filePath) return;

    setLoading(true);
    setError(null);

    import(/* @vite-ignore */ `${filePath}`)
      .then((mod) => setComponent(() => mod.default))
      .catch((err) => {
        console.error("Error loading component:", err);
        setError(err);
      })
      .finally(() => setLoading(false));
  }, [filePath]);

  if (loading) return <div>Loading...</div>;
  if (error) return <div>Error loading component</div>;
  if (!Component) return <div>Component not found</div>;

  return <Component />;
};

// Example usage:
const App = () => {
  const [path, setPath] = useState("./components/MyComponent");

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => setPath("./components/AnotherComponent")}>
        Load Another Component
      </button>
      <DynamicComponent filePath={path} />
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

### Key Points:
- The `filePath` prop is dynamically passed.
- The component is reloaded whenever `filePath` changes.
- `import(/* @vite-ignore */ `${filePath}`)` is used to prevent Vite from processing the path statically.

### Potential Issues with Dynamic Imports in Vite

Vite uses static imports for optimal bundling, and dynamic imports with variables might not work as expected.
Instead of a fully dynamic filePath, consider mapping known components explicitly:

```tsx
const components = {
  myComponent: lazy(() => import("./components/MyComponent")),
  anotherComponent: lazy(() => import("./components/AnotherComponent")),
};

const DynamicComponent = ({ componentKey }) => {
  const Component = components[componentKey];

  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
      {Component ? <Component /> : <div>Component not found</div>}
    </Suspense>
  );
};
```

This approach avoids bundling issues with Vite and keeps the benefits of lazy loading.

It Uses `lazy(() => import(...))` instead of `useEffect` + `useState` for imports.
Avoid dynamic string imports with Vite, as they may not work correctly.
Use an explicit component map if dynamically importing multiple known components.
