# react-playground

## About

This is a playground for testing out react features.  
It uses React + TypeScript + Vite boilerplate from [stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com/).

## Main Goals

- Unopionated testing ground for react features
- No big framework (try to test core features only, bring minimal dependencies)
- Learn and revisit upon new react releases
- In learn mode. Preview all examples in the browser without constantly changing the `main.tsx` file, adding more complexity with a router.

## How To Use

Beside standard clone, install and run (`npm run dev`), use your editor to browse the code and browser to preview all examples.
To isolate to import the example `App` directly to `main.tsx`.

## Prerequisites

[node.js](https://nodejs.org/en): tested with (v22.14.0).
Currently the example tree is generated from `examples.json` file.

## Conventions

- Each example exports `App` and file has `App_` prefix.
- Most examples don't have long descriptions. Make comments directly in the code if necessary.

## Feedback

Contructive feedback welcome in [issues](https://github.com/uicoded/react-playground/issues).
